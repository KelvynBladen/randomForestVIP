The goal of rfvip is to tune and select a good Random Forest model based on the accuracy and variable importance metrics associated with each model. To accomplish this, functions are available to tabulate and plot results designed to help the user select an optimal model. 

This package contains functions for assessing variable relations and associations prior to modeling with a Random Forest algorithm (although these are relevant for any predictive model). Metrics such as partial correlations and variance inflation factors are tabulated as well as plotted for the user using the functions partial_cor() and robust_vifs(). 

The function mtry_compare() is available for tuning the hyper-parameter mtry based on model performance and variable importance metrics. This grid-search technique provides tables and plots showing the effect of mtry on each of the assessment metrics. It also returns each of the evaluated models to the user.

The package also provides superior ggplot2 variable importance plots for singular models using the function ggvip(). This function is a highly aesthetic and editable improvement upon the function randomForest::varImpPlot() and other basic importance graphics.

All of the plots generated by these functions are developed with ggplot2 techniques so that the user has the ability to edit and improve further upon the plots.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(rfvip)
set.seed(1234)

pcs <- partial_cor(medv ~ ., data = MASS::Boston, model = lm)
pcs$plot_y_part_cors

rv <- robust_vifs(medv ~ ., data = MASS::Boston, model = lm)
rv$plot_nonlin_vifs

m <- mtry_compare(medv ~ ., data = MASS::Boston, sqrt = TRUE, 
                  num_var = 7)
m$gg_var_imp_error
m$gg_model_errors
g <- ggvip(m$rf9)
g$both_vips
```
