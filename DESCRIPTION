Title: Tune Random Forests Based On Variable Importance & Plot Results
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kelvyn Bladen
Maintainer: Kelvyn Bladen <kelvyn.bladen@usu.edu>
Description: This package contains functions for assessing variable relations 
    and associations prior to modeling with a Random Forest algorithm (although 
    these are relevant for any predictive model). Metrics such as partial 
    correlations and variance inflation factors are tabulated as well as 
    plotted for the user. A function is available for tuning the hyper-parameter 
    mtry based on model performance and variable importance metrics. This 
    grid-search technique provides tables and plots showing the effect of 
    mtry on each of the assessment metrics. It also returns each of the 
    evaluated models to the user. The package also provides superior ggplot2 
    variable importance plots for singular models. All of the plots are 
    developed with ggplot2 techniques so that the user has the ability to 
    edit and improve further upon the plots.
