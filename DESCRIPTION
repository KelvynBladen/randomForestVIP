Title: Tune Random Forests Based On Variable Importance & Plot Results
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kelvyn Bladen
Maintainer: Kelvyn Bladen <kelvyn.bladen@usu.edu>
Description: This package contains functions for assessing variable
    relations and associations prior to modeling with a Random Forest
    algorithm (although these are relevant for any predictive model).
    Metrics such as partial correlations and variance inflation factors
    are tabulated as well as plotted for the user. A function is available
    for tuning the hyper-parameter mtry based on model performance and
    variable importance metrics. This grid-search technique provides
    tables and plots showing the effect of mtry on each of the assessment
    metrics. It also returns each of the evaluated models to the user. The
    package also provides superior ggplot2 variable importance plots for
    singular models. All of the plots are developed with ggplot2
    techniques so that the user has the ability to edit and improve
    further upon the plots.
